### Prompt : Iâ€™m building a Java application called Quizzify. The idea is to let users create and play custom multiple-choice quizzes. Each quiz has a title and a set of questions. Each question has a correct answer and multiple wrong choices. Users can take quizzes one question at a time and get a score at the end. 
Can you generate detailed user stories, acceptance criteria, and a functional requirements list from the description?
